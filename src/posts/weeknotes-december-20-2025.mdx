I just finished [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I posted my [solutions](https://github.com/isaacmattern/aoc-2025) on GitHub. I was able to solve all the problems myself this year, which I was proud of, *except for* Day 10 part 2, which was a linear programming problem, which I'm not sure I've ever seen before. 

## What I'm Reading

I just finished *The Shining* by Stephen King. I really liked it, even though I've never really read horror before. My friend got me a copy of *No Country For Old Men* for Christmas, so I'll probably start that soon. 

## What I'm Playing

I've been playing a lot of *Animal Crossing* recently. Probably every day for over a month now. It's a great game to get a half hour to an hour in each day. I've also been playing a bit of *Fortnite* with my friends. Overall, I've felt way less of an appetite for single-player video games in the last few months. 

## What I'm Watching

I've been working my way through the first two seasons of *House of the Dragon*... and I think it might be better than *Game of Thrones*! I've also been watching *Pluribus*, but I'm only a few episodes in, and I'm not exactly sure of my opinion of the show just yet.

## Pizza Calculator

I recently added a [Pizza Calculator](https://isaacmattern.com/tools/pizza-calculator) to this site. Soon, I'll add a [tools page](https://isaacmattern.com/tools), and hopefully add fun little tools and calculators and visualization apps whenever I get a good idea and enough time to develop it.
