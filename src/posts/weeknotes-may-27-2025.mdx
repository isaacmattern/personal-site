I have been drinking more coffee and more caffeine recently. Slowly, over time, I have come to accept that my caffeine addiction is cyclical. I have too much daily, then I decide to quit (either gradually or cold turkey), then I go a few months without any, then I have that first sip back and decide I'll modulate (moderate?) my usage - only on the weekends. Okay, maybe every other day? Alright, well maybe every day, but just one 15g cup. Okay, maybe two cups and maybe a nice cherry coke zero as well because life is short, am I right?

My girlfriend recently finished her master's degree and finished student teaching. I am really proud of her. 

I got to visit my gramma and aunt a few weeks ago, and got to see all my brothers and my mom on Mother's Day, which was great.

I finished *The Perennial Philosophy* by Alduous Huxley. Prob wouldn't recommend it to someone looking to get into that type of reading, but it was definitely an interesting read. 

It's summer so I have been eating more ice cream recently which is awesome. Jeni's had a Watermelon Taffy flavor a few years back and I saw it in Target so I bought it. It was the first time they've sold it in a few years and I had a nostalgic flashback to the summers of the COVID era of my life. 

Uhhhhh what else? It kinda feels like I'm waiting for something to happen. I'm not sure what. Trying to just take each day one at a time and enjoy the small things. The happiest moments continue to be those where I'm paying attention to my life as it is, not thinking of a picture of my life as it could be. Not sure if that makes any sense or if I should leave the philosophical paragraphs in the drafts. 

My friend is moving back from outta town back to Columbus soon, which is pretty cool. Each year that passes, there are more reasons for me to stay here than to go anywhere else. I used to think that might be a bad thing, and now I find it comforting. 

I started a Minecraft realm with my friends and brothers. It really is the greatest game of all time. Not even my favorite, but just the greatest. I'm probably gonna be playing this thing when I'm 80
