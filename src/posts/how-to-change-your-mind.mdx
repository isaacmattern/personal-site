description: My review of Michael Pollan's 2018 book on psychedelics
---

I recently finished reading Michael Pollan's 2018 book, which has a very long title *[How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Change_Your_Mind)*. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to almost anyone. 

The book is split into six chapters, but it's effectively 3 main sections:

1. The history of psychedelics (mostly in the context of their use in the United States)
2. The author's personal experiences with multiple psychedelic drugs at high doses with a psychedelic guide
3. A summary of modern research on psychedelics, how they change the brain and mind, and the future use and research of psychedelics

All three of these sections are written very well, although I do have to admit that Pollan's account of his own psychedelic drug trips were the most interesting to me, partially because he's such a great storyteller, and also probably because I listened to the audiobook (which he narrated), and it was cool to hear the stories in his voice. Pollan also just has an enjoyable voice, which I already new since I had listened to [his audiobook on caffeine](https://michaelpollan.com/books/caffeine-how-coffee-and-tea-created-the-modern-world/).

One of the cool takeaways that I got out of reading this book was when Pollan wrote about how the brain scans of clinical trial subjects after having an intense spiritual experience on a high dose of psychedelics were similar to the brain scans of "experienced meditators" (although I'm not sure exactly what the word "experienced" meant). Both groups had significantly lower activity in their [default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network), the part of our brains which is generally active when we don't have a specific task to do and helps us think about our personal selves, whether recalling our pasts or dreaming of our futures. The default mode network is generally what's active when the mind is wandering. Pollan spends a significant amount of time in the latter half of the book discussing the idea that the improvements in well-being that a lot of people see in their lives after a spiritual experience on psychedelics is linked to them thinking about their personal selves less, and seeing themselves as connected to something greater. 

Another interesting thing towards the end of the book that I'm still thinking about is the future of Psychedelic drugs in the United States. It was interesting to me how prestigious medical professionals at psychedelic research conferences warned researched not to promote the recreational use of psychedelic substances under any circumstances since it might jeopardize the status of the drugs, while proponents of recreational use genuinely worry that psychedelics could become over-medicalized, when they really "should" be available for responsible recreational consumption for the betterment of 'well people'. 

Michael Pollan is himself a staunch atheist, and was a convicted materialist and huge skeptic of the usefulness of psychedelics and explains that he grew up in the generation which likely saw the most harsh propaganda against the drugs. Ultimately, I would recommend this book to those completely ignorant of the world of psychedelic research and it's tumultuous history in the United States, or anyone who's already convinced of the productive applications of magic mushrooms and LSD who wants to understand the cultural and scientific context a bit better. 

Overall, I'm going to give this book a **9/10**. Perhaps it's because the book was published in 2018 and their was limited research at the time, but I really wish Pollan would have talked at least a little bit more about [microdosing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_microdosing). He mentioned it in passing once or twice, but especially with his explanation of how certain improvements to addiction or depression from psychedelics began to fade away for some patients six to twelve months after their experience, I felt that at least a few more paragraphs on the concepts of microdosing were warranted, even if he would've attached some disclaimer. Other than that, I would have to describe the book as perfectly written and engaging. I would recommend that you use the audiobook if you give this book a try. I was able to get it for free through the [Libby App](https://libbyapp.com/) with my local library card.
