description: Summer was fun. Football is back!
---

It has been awhile since I've posted. To be honest, I forgot I had a blog for a few days at a time. But hey, that's probably how things should be! In the modern internet age, many big sites and apps constantly buzz on peoples phones to get their attention. It's probably for the best to have a format like this that's less stimulating, that you can forget about and then come back to after you've actually lived life a little more.

## Life recently

Summer came and went, and overall it was pretty good. I went on my first solo vacation. I visited Stockholm, Sweden. It was fun to explore the area on foot, ride a ferry, visit many museums, and have some reflective time by myself away from home. 

Work has been busy recently. I'm not working long hours or anything, but I just feel tired in the evenings. Being deliberate about hanging out with other people definitely helps, but ever since my company went back to fully in-office, I've just felt burnt out in the evenings. I think I need to be more deliberate about how I spend some of my leisure time. 

## Football. Other stuff

Football returned about a month ago, and it's been great. Watching football is genuinely one of my favorite things, but the time commitment between all the teams I follow (and my passion for keeping up with college football in its entirety) has meant that it's tough to be in a groove with my other hobbies. Generally I ease in and out of "default" activities for weeknight evenings. It might be messing around with programming, or producing music, or reading books. But since starting work after college a few years ago, I have noticed that following football in the fall definitely disrupts my ability to get in a nice groove with other activities.

## Music

I'm seeing Bladee in concert tomorrow with my friend, and I'm very excited. It has been awhile since I went to a concert, so I'm really looking forward to it. Some artists I'd love to see soon (or at some point) are kmoe, Jane Remover, 2hollis, or Nate Sib!

I really recommend the album K1 by kmoe, it's definitely going to be one of my top listens by the end of the year! And [the music video for Bloodbath (Dance)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGJ0rGe049M) is super fun and creative.
