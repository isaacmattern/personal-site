description: It's cold outside

It's cold outside. It is also dark outside more often because astronomy, and it feels *even worse* because daylight savings ended. The cold, dark weather can have me feeling sad (especially in Jan/Feb), but I love the holiday season, particularly Christmas. I'm doing Friendsgiving with some friends next weekend, which I'm looking forward to. 

I've been really tired from work recently. I'm hoping to do Advent of Code again this year, though. Should be fun. Ultimately, I'd like to find some more side/mini-projects to work on / code outside of work. We'll see. 

## What I'm Reading

I'm reading *Amusing Ourselves to Death* by Neil Postman. It was written in 1985 but honestly feels even more relevant to today's world. I'll probably write a whole post sharing my thoughts on that once I'm done reading it. 

## What I'm Watching

*House of the Dragon* and *The Chair Company*. *House of the Dragon* is just incredible. I've been pacing myself more slowly than with *Game of Thrones*, which has been a great decision. 

## What I'm Listening To

Lot's of things, but I'm particularly going to shoutout the artist Kiefer. He basically makes jazz music with the lofi hip-hop beats vibe to it. It's too hard to explain, but it's incredible. My two track recommendations: Aaaaa and Ghosted.

## What I'm Drinking

Some great coffee from S&W Roasters in Indiana. Seems like they were remodeling or expanding or something, but I have had trouble ordering from them this year. But I got 3 bags delivered a few weeks ago, and they are all fantastic. 

In general, I actually want to start making my coffee at home *less* on the weekends. I feel like I've fallen behind exploring local coffee shops and now feel a bit out of the loop. I'll report back when I've tried some more, and may even publish my Columbus, OH coffee shop tierlist/rankings I've been working on.
