title: Is There Even a Point Consuming The News Anymore?

I'd consider myself a bit of an information addict. I think a large part of this is just that I have ADHD and I'm always looking for some sort of stimulation or thing to do. I believe this is also a large part of why mindfulness is very important to me. The opposite of mindfulness is mindlessness, and to be honest, most of the time I'm consuming what we generally refer to as "the news", it's in a state of mindlessness. 

I think this is almost a complete waste of my time. If I need to have some stimulation to feed my information addiction, maybe I should find a blog post about something random, read a technical article I find intriguing, or literally just start watching an episode of TV. 

Consuming the news can take many forms, and some of them are more obviously going to make you anxious and disconnected from reality, like many sensationalized TV programs or the front page of Reddit or some other form like that. But I think that even consuming the most highly curated set of news, let's say, a brilliant, unbiased, 30-minute summary, on any more than a biweekly basis, is probably a massive waste of time. 

I think that people who consume more news are generally more disconnected from the state of reality. I **do not** mean "the state of reality" to mean "the state of current events as seen on TV". Most people fundamentally understand this to be true - many nightly news programs will tell you the world is on fire and you need to start freaking out right now. But these programs are incentivized to (and rewarded for) making you think that watching the news is important in the first place (to stay informed, to be safe, to have knowledge of the world "as it is"). This is a [perverse incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive). 

When I consider people I interact with regularly in my life, a lot of them that seem the most worried about the state of the world are the ones who consume the most news. I love these people I'm thinking about, but I think they'd be a lot better off if they almost never consumed the news.  

Not everyone has the immense privilege that I do - the privilege of ignoring the war in Ukraine, or the conflict in the middle east, or the terrorist attack that just occurred halfway across the globe. And I'm certainly not arguing that *everyone* should tune it out all the time. But I don't think that being up to date on global, national, or even state affairs really matters at all. I just think that most people are in denial of the real reason they watch the news.

I consume news because I am using the news as a means to scratch the itch in my brain for information and stimulation. I think that most of the time, everyone else is too, but they're convincing themselves that they're doing their "civic" duty by "staying informed". I think this is just a lie told by people who sell the news. 

Lately in my life, I've tried to be more mindful about specifically stopping myself from consuming the news (or other junk media) as a means to scratch that itch for information. Something to read about. Maybe I need to find something less harmful to point my attention to. But I think I need to find how to sit alone and **notice** the world as it is right now - the colors I see, the air I feel, the sounds I hear - not **read** about what someone else wants me to believe the world to be.
