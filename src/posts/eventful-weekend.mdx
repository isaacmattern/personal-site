## New cat - meet Spike!

Yesterday, I went to the Worthington Farmer's Market with my girlfriend and some of our friends. If you're in Columbus, you should check it out! We had planned to get their early to beat some of the large crowds. Shortly after we got there, we walked past a butcher stand and I noticed two little girls playing with two small kittens in a cat carrier. We stopped to take a look, and the girls informed us that the butcher shop was giving two kittens away for free! Long story short, we took one home. He's about six weeks old, and we named him Spike!

Every time I look at him, I forget how small he is! We took him to the vet, and he weighed in at 1 pound 7 ounces. I'm happy to be able to see him grow up, and I'm excited to see how my 3-year-old cat Honey adjusts to a new kitten. 

## First 10k race!

My first 10 kilometer race is in the books! This morning, I ran the Columbus 10k. I finished with a chip time of 42:23, or a 6:49/mile pace (10k = 6.21 mi). I was aiming for a sub 42 minute time, so I'm slightly disappointed, but I'm still happy with the time. My last 5k race in November was 21:35, so this is definitely a big improvement!

Pacing for a 10k is really difficult. It feels like you have to run fast the entire time, unlike something like a 10-miler or half marathon where you might pace yourself a bit more. I've run tons of 5k races in my life since I used to run cross country, and those aren't too bad because the first mile or so is adrenaline, and so is the last 3/4 of a mile or so. But in the 10k, it felt like most of the race there was no adrenaline, just 5 miles left and feeling like I have to dig in and run almost as fast as I can while keeping in mind I have lots of time left. Overall though, it was fun, and I'd definitely do it again!
