It's the day after Christmas, which means it's almost the new year. It's been really great to take some extended time off of work and spend a lot of time with my family.

I'm writing this post as a way to exercise gratitude. I recently realized that this is the first year in a really long time that there hasn't been a significant amount of change in my life. I lived in the same apartment the entire year, worked the same job. 

Some things that I'm gratfeul for this year:

- Had a lot of opportunities to travel from Columbus, where I live, back home to Warren, where I grew up and where my family still lives. 
- A lot of my friends graduated college or started working full-time in Columbus, including one friend who moved from my hometown to Columbus.
- Got to travel to Boston to visit my friend who just moved there to start a full-time job
- Continued to grow a lot in my role at work. Had a great opportunity to develop something that different teams might be able to utilize.
- Got back into running and ran my first 5k since 2018 (my last high school cross country race)
- Started playing Tennis regularly with my friends over the summer.
- Had a great year of watching sports. Got to attend SO MANY awesome games:
  - Columbus Crew vs. Aston Villa friendly (saw a Cucho hat trick)
  - Ohio State vs Indiana (top 10 matchup)
  - Ohio State vs Tennessee (top 10 matchup & CFP First Round)
- Participated in my high school's "Alumni Marching Band" with my friends, and my little brother who is still in the band. 
- Got to take an amazing trip to Asheville, NC with my girlfiend over the summer. Saw some great mountaintop views and a mama bear with her cubs!
- Saw a [total solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024)! My girlfriend's parents' house was in the path of totality, so a few friends came with us to watch. I feel lucky we didn't have to travel far at all to see something so amazing. 

Some things I'm looking forward to in the new year:

- My girlfriend and I are planning on moving apartments since our current apartment is next to a busy street. I'm looking forward to a year with (hopefully) some more peace and quiet, and potentially a new cat if our next lease allows it!
- My girlfriend will likely complete student teaching and wrap up her master's degree in education, and she can hopefully get a full-time teaching job in the fall. It has been awesome to see her leave the start of a career she didn't like to pursue teaching instead
- Running my first 10K race in June at the Columbus 10K!
- Cheering on six different friends of mine who are running the same half marathon race in April

"Goals" / new years resolutions:
- HOPEFULLY writing more blog posts. Writing these posts are very enjoyable to me and fun to look back at
- Taking more photos. I'm so bad at this. I really enjoyed the app "BeReal" and how it forced me to take a photo of myself / what I was doing every day (before the app got ruined by ads). I might need to find an app that does something similar
