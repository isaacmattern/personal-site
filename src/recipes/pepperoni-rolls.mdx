description: This recipe was handed down from my grandma, to my mom, to me! Fun fact - pepperoni rolls were first created in West Virginia. I have lots of great memories eating pepperoni rolls growing up. This specific recipe was written by my mom.

##  Ingredients
- Rhodes Frozen Bread Loaves (they come in 3 and 5 packs)
- Block mozzarella cheese
- Sliced pepperoni
##  Directions
1. Spray a large 9x13 or 11x14 pan with non stick spay and then place frozen bread dough in pan. Cover pan with plastic wrap, spray it with nonstick spray and then flip it over so that the sprayed side is touching the frozen bread dough. Make sure the rest of pan is completely covered so that dough doesnâ€™t dry out.
2. Let dough rise overnight 8-10+ hours.
4. Cut blocks of mozzarella cheese into thin equal slices (I usually cut the block in half, then half again and keep doing this to make equal slices). Place on plate.
5. Open bags of slices pepperoni and place on plate.
6. Once dough is thawed, cut dough into 7 equal sections (you can do more or less but this is what I do).
7. Pat out each dough section. Fill with alternating layers of pepperoni and cheese slices. (I usually use 3-4 slices pepperoni, 1 slice cheese, 3-4 pepperoni, 1 slice cheese, and 3-4 pepperoni).
8. After dough is filled with pepperoni and cheese, fold over in middle, then fold ends over.
9. Place assembled pepperoni rolls, folded dough side down, on cookie sheets (donâ€™t use specialty cookie sheets, just use simple cheap ones because pepperoni rolls wonâ€™t brown on fancier ones) about 1-2 inches apart. You can also have them touch if you want but all the dough wonâ€™t brown if you do that.
10. Preheat oven to 350.
11. Let assembled rolls rise on or near stove or other warm place in kitchen for 20-30 min or longer or until dough has risen at least slightly.
12. Bake for 23-25 min or until brown.
13. Brush with butter (I just tear the end of the paper off a refrigerated stick of butter and use that to butter the buns. You can just use the part that still has paper on it as a handle. Itâ€™s less messy that way.)
14. Enjoy!!! ðŸ˜„
