title: Peanut Butter Butterscotch Rice Krispie Treats
date: 2025-5-3
description: This is one of my favorite recipes for two reasons - it's super easy to make, and these rice krispie treats don't go stale like normal ones made with marshmallow. These remind me of my gramma - I think she said she found this recipe online somewhere.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup peanut butter
- 1 bag of butterscotch chips
- 6 cups of rice krispies cereal

## Directions
- Melt peanut butter and butterscotch chips in a pot
- Add rice krispies, and stir until combined well (I use a spatula to stir)
- Transfer from the pot into some sort of baking dish, 8x11 should work
- Let cool, either on the counter or in the fridge
- Enjoy

## Notes
You can keep these in the fridge if you like them colder or prefer a bit of a thicker fudge texture, but I like to keep them at room temperature. These treats should stay fresh and crisp for over a week!
