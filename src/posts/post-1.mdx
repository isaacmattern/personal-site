## Motivation

I've wanted to create a blog for awhile. When I decided to start building this blog a few weeks ago, I knew that I wanted to use Markdown for the following reasons, among others:

- It's easy to write a new blog post
- I don't have to worry about an external Content Management System
- I can turn a note from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
